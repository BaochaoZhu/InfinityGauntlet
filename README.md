We proposes a novel fingerprint brute-force attack on off-the-shelf smartphones in [USENIX Security '23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23). We name this new threat model InfinityGauntlet, where Infinity and Gauntlet represent its two core techniques: attempt limit bypassing and fingerprint image hijacking. Adversaries can pass fingerprint authentication with zero knowledge of the victim to unlock the smartphone, log into privacy apps and make payments. We have submitted these vulnerabilities to seven manufacturers, and all have been confirmed and fexed. In order to fill the gap in the research tools of smartphone fingerprint authentication, we decided to open source PCBs, BOMs and firmware of the tool to the academic community. Hope our work can inspire the industry to improve the security of biometric authentication. The demo video only demonstrates a rough attack flow, please refer to the paper for details.
